# TMTeachingTurtles
(TeenageMutantTeachingTurtles) Repository for code workshops by using turtles. Currently, we will have our intro to python turtles course which we typically run "live" so we may not need any workbooks here outside of reference materials. However, we will also be storing our "data with turtles" materials where we introduce pandas data frames.
